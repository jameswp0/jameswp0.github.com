<p> 
	<a href="http://connectedlearning.tv/infographicv">Connected Learning</a> is a modern pedagogical approach holding that knowledge and learning is distributed across a social, conceptual network. It holds that when people forge, negotiate and nurture connections for themselves (between people, information, knowledge, ideas and concepts), learning is more powerful and sustainable.

<p>
	The CLA toolkit helps students and teachers to harvest data about their activities in standard social media environments, and then provide immediate feedback and reports. It is currently in development, but the basic design is sketched out below:

</p>
<p> 
	The CLA toolkit relies heavily upon the <a href="http://www.adlnet.gov/tla/experience-api/">Experience API (xAPI)</a>, which makes it possible to capture student behaviour in a highly flexible manner and send it to a Learning Record Store (LRS) for immediate or later analysis. We currently have tools in development that will interface with the API's of

		<li>Twitter</li>
		<li>StackExchange</li>
		<li>Google Docs</li>	     
		<li>Facebook</li>
		<li>RSS feeds (i.e. blogs)</li>
